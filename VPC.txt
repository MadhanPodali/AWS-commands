ipconfig = To list all the IP address in windows

ifconfig = To list all the TP address in Linus

http://whatismyipaddress.com/ = To know the Public IP of our network

THIS ARE PRIVATE IPS
---------------------
A = 10.0.0.0    - 10.255.255.255   Highest range = 10.0.0.0/16 = 65,536  ==> 65,536-5 = 65,531
B = 172.16.0.0  - 172.32.255.255   Lowest  range = 10.0.0.0/24 = 256     ==> 256-5  = 251
C = 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255

General N/W : 2 IPS reserved   
    AWS     : 3 IPS reserved 

Class A  : N.H.H.H : 127 Networks, Each network supports 16M hosts. 
Class B  : N.N.H.H : 16,000 Network, Each network supports ,Each network supports 65,000 Hosts
Class: N.N.N.H : 2M Networks, Each network supports 256 Hosts.

CIDR Block Range = 10.0.0.0/16 = 65536 IP's (Maximum)
                 = 10.0.0.0/24 = 256 IP's   (Minimum)


JUMP Server :
------------
        A jump server (or jump box) is a secure, intermediary server used to connect to other servers or devices in a private network. It acts as a bridge between the external network (e.g., the internet) and the internal, secure network.

 Prevents direct access to sensitive servers from the internet, Acts as a single entry point.


VPC Flow Logs :
--------------
   It is used to monitor the traffic or request that are performed in the VPC level.  


Difference between NAT Gateway AND Internet Gateway :
----------------------------------------------------

NAT Gateway 
----------- 
 1) Allows resources in private subnets to access the internet (outbound only), but We can't directly access the resources that are present in the private .
 
 2) It is deployed in a public subnet but used by private subnets for outbound internet access.
 
 3) It has only one way access to the internet (Outbound only - one way connection).

Internet Gateway
----------------

1) Directly connects public subnets to the internet , we can access the resources through the internet.

2) It is attached at the VPC level, making it accessible for public subnets in the VPC.

3) It has access for both in bounded and out bounded traffic (Two way connection).
   

To make VPC more secure :
---------------------------

NACL = It works at subnet level 

Security GROUP =  It works at resources level
